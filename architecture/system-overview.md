# Nexus MCP Hub: System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Nexus MCP Hub is a central management system for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, designed to facilitate the creation and operation of AI agents. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, including the reference model, component interactions, and workflows.

## Reference Model

The Nexus MCP Hub is built on the official [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) specification, which defines a standardized way for AI models to interact with tools, data sources, and other systems.

### MCP Core Concepts

![MCP Core Concepts](../assets/images/mcp-core-concepts.svg)

The Model Context Protocol is based on several key concepts:

1. **Context**: The shared state between a model and its environment
2. **Tools**: Functions that models can call to interact with external systems
3. **Transport**: The communication layer between models and tools (HTTP, WebSockets, stdio)
4. **Messages**: Structured data exchanged between components

### Protocol Flow

The basic flow of the Model Context Protocol is:

1. Client sends a request to an MCP server
2. Server processes the request, potentially calling tools
3. Server returns a response to the client
4. Context is maintained across multiple interactions

## System Architecture

The Nexus MCP Hub extends the base MCP model with a hub-and-spoke architecture that enables centralized management of multiple MCP servers.

### High-Level Architecture

The system consists of the following major components:

1. **Nexus Hub**: The central management component
2. **MCP Servers**: Specialized servers providing specific capabilities
3. **Agents**: AI assistants that leverage multiple MCP servers
4. **Client Applications**: User interfaces for interacting with agents

### Component Interactions

![Component Interactions](../assets/images/component-interactions.png)

The components interact through standardized interfaces:

1. **Client-Hub Interface**: REST API and WebSockets
2. **Hub-Server Interface**: Model Context Protocol
3. **Agent-Hub Interface**: Internal API
4. **Hub-Database Interface**: Data access layer

## MCP Server Ecosystem

The Nexus MCP Hub integrates with a diverse ecosystem of MCP servers, each providing specialized capabilities.

### Server Types

![MCP Server Types](../assets/images/mcp-server-types.png)

The current ecosystem includes:

1. **Ollama MCP (Port 3011)**: Language model inference
2. **ComfyUI MCP (Port 3020)**: Image generation and editing
3. **Supabase MCP (Port 3007)**: Database operations
4. **Terminal MCP (Port 3014)**: Command execution
5. **Memory Server**: Context management
6. **File Explorer**: File system operations
7. **Code Sandbox**: Code execution

### Server Registration

MCP servers are registered with the Nexus Hub through a discovery process:

```mermaid

    participant MCP Server
    participant Nexus Hub
    participant Registry

    MCP Server->>Nexus Hub: Register(capabilities, endpoint)
    Nexus Hub->>Registry: Store(server_info)
    Registry-->>Nexus Hub: Confirmation
    Nexus Hub-->>MCP Server: Registration Successful
```

## Agent Architecture

Agents in the Nexus MCP Hub are AI assistants that leverage multiple MCP servers to perform complex tasks.

### Agent Components

![Agent Components](../assets/images/agent-components.svg)

Each agent consists of:

1. **Core Model**: The foundation AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4)
2. **Tool Router**: Directs tool calls to appropriate MCP servers
3. **Context Manager**: Maintains state across interactions
4. **Task Planner**: Breaks down complex tasks into steps
5. **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves relevant information

### Agent Workflow

The typical workflow of an agent handling a user request:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Agent]
    B --> C{Task Planning}
    C --> D[Tool Selection]
    D --> E[MCP Server 1]
    D --> F[MCP Server 2]
    D --> G[MCP Server 3]
    E --> H[Result Integration]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> I[Response Generation]
    I --> J[User Response]
```

## User Workflows

The Nexus MCP Hub supports various user workflows for different use cases.

### Agent Creation Workflow

![Agent Creation Workflow](../assets/images/agent-creation-workflow.svg)

The process of creating a new agent:

1. Define agent purpose and capabilities
2. Select required MCP servers
3. Configure agent parameters
4. Test agent performance
5. Deploy agent for use

### Task Execution Workflow

The process of executing a task with an agent:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Nexus Hub
    participant Agent
    participant MCP Servers

    User->>Nexus Hub: Submit Task
    Nexus Hub->>Agent: Assign Task
    Agent->>Agent: Plan Task Execution
    loop For each step
        Agent->>MCP Servers: Execute Tool Call
        MCP Servers-->>Agent: Tool Results
        Agent->>Agent: Update Context
    end
    Agent-->>Nexus Hub: Task Results
    Nexus Hub-->>User: Results Presentation
```

## Deployment Architecture

The Nexus MCP Hub can be deployed in various configurations to suit different needs.

### Local Development Setup

![Local Development Setup](../assets/images/local-development-setup.svg)

For development and testing:

1. All components run on the developer's machine
2. Local database for persistence
3. Direct connections between components

### Production Deployment

For production environments:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Applications] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Nexus Hub Cluster]
    C --> D[MCP Server Pool]
    C --> E[Database Cluster]
    C --> F[Message Queue]
    F --> G[Background Workers]
```

## Security Model

The Nexus MCP Hub implements a comprehensive security model to protect data and ensure proper access control.

### Authentication and Authorization

![Auth Flow](../assets/images/auth-flow.svg)

The security model includes:

1. User authentication using JWT tokens
2. Role-based access control for MCP servers and agents
3. API rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Audit logging of all operations

## Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive monitoring and observability features:

```mermaid
