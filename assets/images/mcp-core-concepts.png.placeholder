This is a placeholder for the MCP Core Concepts diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Context - The shared state between a model and its environment
2. Tools - Functions that models can call to interact with external systems
3. Transport - The communication layer between models and tools (HTTP, WebSockets, stdio)
4. Messages - Structured data exchanged between components

The diagram should use a consistent style and color scheme, with clear labels and visual hierarchy.
