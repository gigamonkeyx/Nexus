This is a placeholder for the Software Development Workflow diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Project Setup - Create a new project or connect to an existing one
2. Code Generation - Describe features or components to implement
3. Code Review - Submit code for review and implement improvements
4. Testing - Generate test cases and execute tests
5. Documentation - Generate documentation for code

The diagram should show how the Nexus MCP Hub and its agents (particularly CodeAssistant) are involved in each step of the software development process.
