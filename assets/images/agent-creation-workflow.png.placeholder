This is a placeholder for the Agent Creation Workflow diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Define Purpose - Identify the specific tasks the agent will perform
2. Select Model - Choose an appropriate foundation model
3. Choose MCP Servers - Select MCP servers based on required capabilities
4. Configure Agent - Set agent name, description, type, capabilities, and parameters
5. Test and Deploy - Test the agent with sample tasks and deploy for production use

The diagram should use a flowchart style to show the sequence of steps in the agent creation process.
