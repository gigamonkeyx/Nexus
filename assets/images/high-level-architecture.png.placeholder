This is a placeholder for the High-Level Architecture diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Nexus Hub - The central management component
   - Server Registry
   - Request Router
   - Authentication Service
   - Monitoring System
2. MCP Servers - Specialized servers providing specific capabilities
   - Ollama MCP (Port 3011)
   - ComfyUI MCP (Port 3020)
   - Supabase MCP (Port 3007)
   - Terminal MCP (Port 3014)
   - Memory Server (stdio)
   - File Explorer (stdio)
   - Code Sandbox (stdio)
3. Agents - AI assistants that leverage multiple MCP servers
   - CodeAssistant
   - Librarian
   - DataSage
   - Muse
   - Sage
4. Client Applications - User interfaces for interacting with agents
   - Web Interface
   - VS Code Extension
   - API Clients

The diagram should use a hub-and-spoke model to show the central role of the Nexus Hub.
