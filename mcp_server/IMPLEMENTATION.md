# MCP Server Implementation

This document provides an overview of the MCP server implementation for the Code Enhancement server.

## Overview

We've implemented a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for enhancing code. This server can be used by Augment through the Nexus MCP Hub to improve code quality.

## Implementation Details

### Server Implementation

We've used the official MCP Python SDK to implement our server. Specifically, we're using the `FastMCP` class, which provides a high-level interface for creating MCP servers.

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="Code Enhancement",
    description="Provides tools for enhancing code",
    version="0.1.0",
)
```

### Tools

We've implemented three tools for code enhancement:

1. **format_code**: Formats code according to language-specific style guidelines
2. **analyze_code**: Analyzes code for potential issues and improvements
3. **generate_docstring**: Generates docstrings for functions and classes

Each tool is implemented as a Python function decorated with `@mcp.tool()`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def format_code(code: str, language: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Format code according to language-specific style guidelines.
    
    Args:
        code: The code to format
        language: The programming language of the code
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with formatted code and language
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Testing

We've implemented a test script that uses the MCP client to test the server:

```python
async def test_server():
    """Test the MCP server using the MCP client."""
    # Create server parameters for stdio connection
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["code_enhancement_server.py"],
        env=None,
    )
    
    # Connect to the server
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            # Initialize the connection
            await session.initialize()
            
            # Test tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            
            # Test format_code tool
            format_result = await session.call_tool(
                "format_code",
                {
                    "code": SAMPLE_PYTHON_CODE,
                    "language": "python"
                }
            )
            
            # More tests...
```

### Nexus Integration

We've implemented a script to register the MCP server with the Nexus MCP Hub:

```python
def register_server():
    """Register the MCP server with Nexus Hub."""
    # Server configuration
    server_config = {
        "id": MCP_SERVER_ID,
        "config": {
            "name": "Code Enhancement Server",
            "description": "Provides tools for enhancing code",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["code_enhancement_server.py"],
            "auto_start": True,
            "auto_restart": True,
            "transport": "stdio"
        }
    }
    
    # Register with Nexus Hub
    response = requests.post(
        f"{NEXUS_URL}/api/servers",
        json=server_config,
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {NEXUS_API_KEY}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    )
```

## Key Features

1. **Standards Compliance**: The server follows the official MCP specification
2. **Tool-based Architecture**: The server exposes functionality through tools
3. **Language Support**: The server supports multiple programming languages
4. **Nexus Integration**: The server can be registered with the Nexus MCP Hub
5. **VS Code Extension**: The server can be used through the VS Code extension

## Usage

### Running the Server Directly

```bash
python code_enhancement_server.py
```

### Testing the Server

```bash
python test_server.py
```

### Registering with Nexus

```bash
python register_with_nexus.py
```

## Integration with Augment

This MCP server enhances Augment's capabilities by providing specialized code enhancement tools. When integrated with the Nexus MCP Hub and the VS Code extension, Augment can:

1. Format code according to language-specific style guidelines
2. Analyze code for potential issues and improvements
3. Generate docstrings for functions and classes

This allows Augment to provide more accurate and helpful code-related assistance.

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Tool Implementations**: Enhance the tools with more sophisticated code analysis and formatting
2. **Add More Languages**: Support additional programming languages
3. **Add Resources**: Implement resources for providing code examples and documentation
4. **Add Prompts**: Implement prompts for common code-related tasks
5. **Enhance Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests for the server

## Conclusion

We've successfully implemented an MCP server that provides code enhancement tools. This server can be integrated with the Nexus MCP Hub and used by Augment to enhance its code-related capabilities.
