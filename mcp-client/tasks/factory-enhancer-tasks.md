# Factory Enhancer Agent Tasks

This document outlines the tasks for the Factory Enhancer Agent to implement enhancements to the AI Agent Factory.

## Task 1: Implement τ-Bench Integration

### Overview

Implement a basic version of the τ-bench integration for the AI Agent Factory. This will enable us to evaluate agents in dynamic real-world settings with user and tool interactions.

### Requirements

1. Create a `TauBenchAdapter` class that interfaces between our AI Agent Factory and the τ-bench framework
2. Implement a simple `UserSimulator` that can generate realistic user interactions
3. Create a basic `ToolAPIManager` for simulating tool APIs
4. Implement a `PolicyEngine` for enforcing domain-specific policies
5. Integrate with the existing `AgentTester` component

### Implementation Details

#### 1. TauBenchAdapter

Create a new file at `src/benchmarks/tau-bench/TauBenchAdapter.ts` with the following functionality:

- Configuration options for domain, number of runs, max turns, etc.
- Method to run benchmarks for an agent
- Method to run individual scenarios
- Integration with other τ-bench components

#### 2. UserSimulator

Create a new file at `src/benchmarks/tau-bench/UserSimulator.ts` with the following functionality:

- Method to generate initial user messages
- Method to generate follow-up messages based on conversation history
- Integration with Ollama for LLM-based user simulation

#### 3. ToolAPIManager

Create a new file at `src/benchmarks/tau-bench/ToolAPIManager.ts` with the following functionality:

- Methods to initialize state for scenarios
- Methods to execute tool calls and update state
- Support for at least one domain (e.g., retail)

#### 4. PolicyEngine

Create a new file at `src/benchmarks/tau-bench/PolicyEngine.ts` with the following functionality:

- Methods to evaluate conversations against policies
- Support for different policy types (regex, semantic, LLM)
- Scoring mechanism for policy adherence

#### 5. Integration with AgentTester

Update the `AgentTester` class to include τ-bench integration:

- Add a method to run τ-bench benchmarks
- Include τ-bench results in the overall test results
- Add configuration options for τ-bench

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The τ-bench integration should be able to evaluate agents in at least one domain
2. The integration should support pass^k metrics for reliability testing
3. The implementation should be modular and extensible
4. The code should include comprehensive error handling and logging
5. The implementation should be well-documented

## Task 2: Implement Continuous Learning Module

### Overview

Implement a basic version of the Continuous Learning Module for the AI Agent Factory. This will enable agents to learn and improve over time based on feedback and experience.

### Requirements

1. Create a `ContinuousLearningModule` class that orchestrates the continuous learning process
2. Implement a `FeedbackSystem` for collecting and analyzing feedback
3. Create a `MemoryManager` for storing and retrieving agent experiences
4. Implement a `ModelUpdater` for updating agent models
5. Integrate with the existing `MetaAgent` component

### Implementation Details

#### 1. ContinuousLearningModule

Create a new file at `src/agents/learning/ContinuousLearningModule.ts` with the following functionality:

- Configuration options for feedback sources, memory type, update frequency, etc.
- Methods to process interactions and feedback
- Methods to update agent models
- Integration with other continuous learning components

#### 2. FeedbackSystem

Create a new file at `src/agents/learning/FeedbackSystem.ts` with the following functionality:

- Methods to extract implicit feedback from interactions
- Methods to collect explicit feedback from users
- Support for different feedback sources

#### 3. MemoryManager

Create a new file at `src/agents/learning/MemoryManager.ts` with the following functionality:

- Methods to store and retrieve memories
- Support for different memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- Memory ranking and relevance determination

#### 4. ModelUpdater

Create a new file at `src/agents/learning/ModelUpdater.ts` with the following functionality:

- Methods to update agent models based on feedback and experiences
- Support for different update strategies
- Integration with Ollama for model fine-tuning

#### 5. Integration with MetaAgent

Update the `MetaAgent` class to include continuous learning integration:

- Add a continuous learning module property
- Set up event listeners for agent interactions
- Add methods to get agent learning progress

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The continuous learning module should be able to collect and process feedback
2. The implementation should support at least one memory type
3. The module should be able to update agent models based on feedback
4. The code should include comprehensive error handling and logging
5. The implementation should be well-documented

### Requirements

1. Refactor the `MetaAgent` class to improve separation of concerns
2. Enhance error handling and logging throughout the codebase
3. Improve event handling and communication between components
4. Add configuration options for different components
5. Implement a plugin system for extending the factory

### Implementation Details

#### 1. MetaAgent Refactoring

Update the `MetaAgent` class to improve its architecture:

- Split into smaller, more focused classes
- Improve dependency injection
- Enhance configuration options

#### 2. Error Handling and Logging
