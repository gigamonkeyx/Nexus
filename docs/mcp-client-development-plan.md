# MCP Client Development Plan for Nexus Hub

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for creating an LLM-compatible client that will integrate with our existing MCP servers.

## Architecture

The MCP client will follow the standard MCP architecture:

1. **Client Core**: Handles communication with MCP servers using the protocol
2. **Transport Layer**: Supports both HTTP/SSE and stdio transports
3. **LLM Integration Layer**: Adapts MCP tools for use with different LLM providers
4. **Agent Framework**: Orchestrates tool usage across multiple servers

## Key Components

### 1. Core Client Library

The core client library will handle the fundamental communication with MCP servers:

- **Server Connection Management**: Connect to and manage multiple MCP servers
- **Tool Discovery**: Discover and register tools from connected servers
- **Tool Execution**: Execute tools on appropriate servers
- **Transport Abstraction**: Support different transport mechanisms (stdio, HTTP/SSE)

### 2. LLM Integration Layer

The LLM integration layer will adapt MCP tools for use with different LLM providers:

- **Tool Format Conversion**: Convert MCP tool definitions to LLM-specific formats
- **Response Processing**: Handle LLM responses and tool calls
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context across multiple interactions

### 3. Server Manager

The server manager will handle the registration and monitoring of MCP servers:

- **Server Registration**: Register server configurations
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor server health and status
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Reconnect to servers when connections are lost

### 4. Agent Framework

The agent framework will provide a structure for building AI agents that use MCP tools:

- **Task Planning**: Plan and execute complex tasks
- **Tool Selection**: Select appropriate tools for tasks
- **Result Evaluation**: Evaluate tool results and determine next steps

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

1. **Build Core Client Library**
   - Implement transport abstractions for stdio and HTTP/SSE
   - Create unified tool calling interface
   - Build server discovery mechanism

2. **Create LLM Adapters**
   - Implement Anthropic adapter for Claude
   - Implement OpenAI adapter
   - Implement Ollama adapter for local models

3. **Develop Server Manager**
   - Create server registration system
   - Implement health monitoring
   - Build automatic reconnection logic

### Phase 2: Agent Development (Next)

1. **Build Agent Framework**
   - Develop task planning system
   - Implement tool selection logic
   - Create result evaluation mechanism

2. **Create Specialized Agents**
   - Research Agent using Supabase MCP
   - Creative Agent using ComfyUI MCP
   - Development Agent using Code Sandbox and Terminal MCP

3. **Implement Agent Coordination**
   - Build agent communication system
   - Create workflow orchestration
   - Implement resource sharing

### Phase 3: Integration and Deployment (Future)

1. **Integrate with Nexus Hub**
   - Connect client to Nexus Hub API
   - Implement server registration through Nexus Hub
   - Create unified management interface

2. **Build User Interfaces**
   - Develop CLI for agent interaction
   - Create web UI for agent management
   - Implement VS Code extension

3. **Deploy and Scale**
   - Set up production deployment
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Create scaling infrastructure

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

- **MCP SDK**: For communication with MCP servers
- **LLM Client Libraries**: For integration with LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Transport Libraries**: For HTTP/SSE and stdio communication
- **Nexus Hub API**: For integration with the Nexus Hub

### Supported LLM Providers

1. **Anthropic Claude**
   - Most compatible with MCP
   - Excellent tool usage capabilities
   - Strong context handling

2. **OpenAI**
   - Widely used
   - Good function calling support
   - Extensive documentation

3. **Local Models via Ollama**
   - Privacy-focused
   - No API costs
   - Customizable models

### Supported Transports

1. **stdio**
   - For local MCP servers
   - Simple process management
   - Efficient for same-machine communication

2. **HTTP/SSE**
   - For remote MCP servers
   - Web-compatible
   - Supports authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Server Testing**
   - Finish testing remaining MCP servers
   - Document capabilities and requirements
   - Fix any issues encountered

2. **Begin Core Client Development**
   - Set up project structure
   - Implement basic client functionality
   - Create transport abstractions

3. **Create First LLM Integration**
   - Start with Claude integration (most compatible with MCP)
   - Test with ComfyUI and Supabase MCP servers
   - Document integration process

## Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing an LLM-compatible client for our MCP servers as part of the Nexus Hub. By following this approach, we'll create a flexible, powerful system that can leverage the capabilities of our existing MCP servers to build sophisticated AI agents.

The client will support both HTTP and stdio transports, work with multiple LLM providers, and provide a framework for building specialized agents. This will enable us to create a rich ecosystem of AI capabilities that can be used across our applications.
