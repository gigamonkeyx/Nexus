| `apply_controlnet` | Apply ControlNet to guide image generation |
| `apply_ip_adapter` | Use IP-Adapter to apply reference image style |
| `segment_and_inpaint` | Automatically segment and inpaint specific areas |
| `list_models` | List available models in ComfyUI |
| `import_workflow` | Import a ComfyUI workflow |

### 2.3 Workflow Management

The ComfyUI MCP server includes sophisticated workflow management:

- **Workflow Import**: Import workflows from URLs or JSON
- **Workflow Execution**: Execute workflows with custom parameters
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined workflows for common tasks
- **Custom Node Support**: Support for custom ComfyUI nodes

### 2.4 Integration Patterns

Key integration patterns observed in the ComfyUI MCP server:

1. **Workflow Translation**: Converting MCP tool calls to ComfyUI workflows
2. **Asset Management**: Storing and retrieving generated images
3. **Parameter Normalization**: Converting between MCP parameters and ComfyUI parameters
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for workflow execution
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring and reporting workflow execution progress

## 3. Client Integration Recommendations
