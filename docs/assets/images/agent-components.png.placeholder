This is a placeholder for the Agent Components diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Core Model - The foundation AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4)
2. Tool Router - Directs tool calls to appropriate MCP servers
3. Context Manager - Maintains state across interactions
4. Task Planner - Breaks down complex tasks into steps
5. Memory System - Stores and retrieves relevant information

The diagram should show how these components interact with each other and with the MCP servers.
