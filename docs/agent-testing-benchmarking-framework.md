**Metrics**: 
- pass@k (k=1, 5, 10, 100)
- Execution accuracy
- Syntax correctness

**Integration**: The MCP Benchmark Server will expose a `run_humaneval_benchmark` tool that runs the agent against the HumanEval dataset and calculates performance metrics.

### 3.2 CodeXGLUE

**What it is**: A comprehensive suite of tasks for evaluating code-related skills, including code completion, bug detection, and code translation.

**Best for**: Assessing a broad range of coding abilities across multiple languages and tasks.

**Metrics**:
- BLEU score for code generation
- CodeBLEU for code quality
- Task-specific metrics for each subtask

**Integration**: The MCP Benchmark Server will expose tools for each CodeXGLUE task, allowing agents to be evaluated on specific capabilities.

### 3.3 τ-bench

**What it is**: A benchmark focused on evaluating AI agents in dynamic, real-world scenarios with user and tool interactions.

**Best for**: Testing agents that go beyond code generation, such as those that debug code, refactor it, or integrate with tools.

**Metrics**:
- Task completion rate
- Interaction efficiency
- Tool usage effectiveness

**Integration**: The MCP Benchmark Server will create simulated environments for τ-bench scenarios and evaluate agent performance in these environments.

### 3.4 AgentBench

**What it is**: A benchmark for testing language models as autonomous agents across different environments.

**Best for**: Evaluating an agent's ability to act independently in coding scenarios.

**Metrics**:
- Decision quality
- Action efficiency
- Goal achievement rate

**Integration**: The MCP Benchmark Server will implement AgentBench environments and evaluate agent performance in these environments.

### 3.5 MLE-bench

**What it is**: A benchmark that uses Kaggle competitions to test coding agents on machine learning tasks.

**Best for**: Agents specialized in machine learning or data science.

**Metrics**:
